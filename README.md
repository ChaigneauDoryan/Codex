## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project locally.

### 1. Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) running locally or on a server.

### 2. Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd Codex
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### 3. Environment Setup

1.  Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project by copying the example file:
    ```bash
    cp .env .env.local
    ```

2.  Update the variables in `.env.local` with your local configuration. At a minimum, you will need to set:
    ```env
    # Prisma
    DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE?schema=public"

    # NextAuth
    NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
    NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-super-secret-key"

    # Google Provider (NextAuth)
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="your-google-client-id"
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="your-google-client-secret"

    # Google Books API
    GOOGLE_BOOKS_API_KEY="your-google-books-api-key"

    # Resend API for emails
    RESEND_API_KEY="your_resend_api_key"
    ```

### 4. Database Setup

1.  **Apply database migrations:** This will create the necessary tables in your database based on the schema.
    ```bash
    npx prisma migrate dev
    ```

2.  **(Optional) Seed the database:** This will populate the database with initial data.
    ```bash
    npx prisma db seed
    ```

### 5. Run the Development Server

Start the Next.js development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
